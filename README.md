# SimpleMovieReviews
A Simple Android Project Using Android Architecture Components

This project focuses on using ViewModel and LiveData from AAC to achieve a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) software architecture and giving the application a clean and modular codebase. 
It uses the TMDB API called using Retrofit and parsed with GSON to pull down movies from the latest release genre. These movies are then populated into a recyclerview when the app loads.
