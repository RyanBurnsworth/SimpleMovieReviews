# SimpleMovieReviews
A Simple Android Project Using Android Architecture Components

This project focuses on using ViewModel and LiveData from AAC to achieve a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) software architecture and giving the application a clean and modular codebase. 
It uses the TMDB API called using Retrofit and parsed with GSON to pull down movies from the horror genre. These movies are then populated into a recyclerview when the app loads.
